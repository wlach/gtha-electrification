# Financials

## Utility Bills

```sql total_cost
with totals as (
    select cast(Month as date) as month, "Total electricity bill" as total, 'electricity' as bill_type from utility_measures.utility_measures
    union all
    select cast(Month as date) as month, "Total gas bill" as total, 'gas' as bill_type from utility_measures.utility_measures
    order by month asc
)
select * from totals where month >= '2022-09-01' and month < '2024-09-01'
```

```sql temperature_by_month
select tbm.month,mean_temp_c from weather.temperature_by_month tbm
join (${total_cost}) tc on tc.month = tbm.month
group by 1, 2
order by tbm.month
```

I think the most intuitive way of looking at the financial impact is to just look at utility bills, month over month. What do they add up to?
From this, we can get an idea on the effect of our actions.

For the purposes of this site, I'm going to directly compare the period between September 2022 and August 2023 (the year before the work was done) with the period between September 2023 and August 2024 (the year after the work was done).
There's obvious reasons why these periods aren't _directly_ comparable but you have to start somewhere, right?

Let's graph that out:

<AreaChart
data={total_cost}
x=month
y=total
yFmt="cad"
series=bill_type
title="Utility Bills (total)"
connectGroup=total_bill_cost>
<ReferenceLine x="2023-10-01" label="Heat Pump" hideValue=true />
<ReferenceLine x="2023-11-01" label="Solar Panels" hideValue=true />
</AreaChart>

<LineChart
    data={temperature_by_month}
    x=month
    y=mean_temp_c
    title="Monthly Mean Temperature"
    yFmt='#,##0.00"Â°C"'
    connectGroup=total_bill_cost
/>

Just glancing at it, you can see that our overall energy costs have gone **up** in January over the previous year, despite the fact that we've added solar panels and insulation.
Part of this is just due to the fact that January was just a colder month in 2024 than it was in 2023, but it does illustrate the general point that a heat pump is not going to be a panacea: it may be efficient, but it still costs money to run!

That aside, I think it's a bit of mistake to compare this change over such a short period.
The more meaningful comparison is over a whole year.

```sql total_cost_year
with base_year as (
    select '2022-2023' as period,
           sum("Total electricity bill") + sum("Total gas bill") as total
    from utility_measures.utility_measures
    where Month >= '2022-09-01' and Month <= '2023-08-31'
),
solar_value as (
    select '2023-2024 (no solar credit)' as period,
           sum("Total electricity bill") + sum("Total gas bill") +
           (select sum(kWh) * 0.13 from utility_measures.solar_output) as total

    from utility_measures.utility_measures
    where Month >= '2023-09-01' and Month <= '2024-08-31'
)
select period, total,
       (select total from base_year) - total as savings
from (
    select '2022-2023' as period,
           sum("Total electricity bill") + sum("Total gas bill") as total
    from utility_measures.utility_measures
    where Month >= '2022-09-01' and Month <= '2023-08-31'
    union all
    select '2023-2024' as period,
           sum("Total electricity bill") + sum("Total gas bill") as total
    from utility_measures.utility_measures
    where Month >= '2023-09-01' and Month <= '2024-08-31'
    union all

```

<DataTable data={total_cost_year}>
    <Column id="period" title="Period" />
    <Column id="total" title="Total cost" fmt=cad />
    <Column id="savings" title="Savings (cost) vs 2022-2023" fmt=cad />
</DataTable>

The first two rows represent actual, real numbers.
Unfortunately my utility bills don't go any further back than September 2022, so I can't really do an apples-to-apples comparison of the "total utility bill cost".

I also included some bonus calculations for a few counterfactuals:

1. The "no gas" row is just me subtracting out the gas bill from the 2023-2024 period.
   As mentioned in the [narrative](./electrification-and-solar) section: we're only using gas for the dryer
   (and very little at that), so the expense is almost entirely fixed charges which we could have avoided if we were a little more aggressive about buying new appliances.
1. Since a solar system doesn't make sense for everyone, I thought it might be useful to look at costs with no solar system installed. For these calculations, I estimated we would have had to purchase all the solar energy we generated from the utility at approximately $0.12 per kWh (this is a conservative estimate that accounts for both the electricity rate and delivery charges we would have paid).

I really do want to emphasize that this isn't an apples-to-apples comparison.
There are just so many reasons why the numbers are the way they are:

1. Our solar system was only installed in mid-November 2023, so these numbers don't reflect the savings that I'd expect if we had the system installed in a full year. In particular, September and October are usually good solar months.
1. Weather differences (which you can see in the chart above).
1. As mentioned on the energy page, we had an inefficient dehumidifier running in the basement which somewhat distorted our energy use. I honestly don't remember if we were running it constantly in 2022/2023.
1. We used air conditioning more in 2024, especially in June/July/August. Central air conditioning is nice, what can I say?
1. Shifting commodity and energy prices year over year.
1. The [Canadian Carbon Tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_pricing_in_Canada) (which was offset by a rebate in Ontario, not incorporated into these numbers).

Even discounting all of that, I feel there's still a pretty overall picture emerging here:

1. On a pure cost basis, a heat pump with electric backup is going to be more expensive than a natural gas furnace given current commodity prices. The difference isn't huge (and arguably worth it given the environmental benefits), but it is there.
1. An appropriately-sized solar system can help defray these costs, although of course it represents an initial investment which has to be paid off.

On the second point, let's look more closely at the solar system and its economics.

## Solar

The above tells a story of how, so long as natural gas remains relatively cheap and electricity expensive by comparison, heating a house with the former is going to win out economically.
I thought it would be useful to break out the solar system by itself, although note that this system wouldn't have really made sense for us pre-heat-pump (when our electricity usage would have been less than the total output of the solar system) since net metering has no provision to credit you for over-production.

### Net metering

At the time we installed the solar system, you could **only** use this program in conjunction with
the tiered rate plan, which gives a fixed rate for the first block of electricity (600 in the summer, 1000 in the winter)
and a higher rate for the second block.
This makes it pretty easy to calculate the value of your solar installation, assuming
your production is less than or equal to your consumption, just measure the net production per month and then apply the tiered rate to it.

Most months we consume well under 1000 kWh, so the value of the solar energy we produce is the lower rate (about 10 cents per kWh).
Here's a chart of our monthly savings from the system:

```sql net_metering_value

    left join solar_data sd on am.month = sd.month

        ) * 0.125 AS higher_tier_value, -- Higher tier rate

                    ELSE 600
                END
            )
        ) * 0.103 AS lower_tier_value -- Lower tier rate
    FROM values_by_month
)
SELECT
    date_month AS "month",
    'Lower Tier' AS category,
    lower_tier_value AS value
FROM monthly_tier_calculations

UNION ALL

SELECT
    date_month AS "month",
    'Higher Tier' AS category,
    higher_tier_value AS value
FROM monthly_tier_calculations

ORDER BY "month", category
```

<BarChart 
    data={net_metering_value}
    x=month
    y=value
    yFmt=cad
    series=category
    title="Tiered value by month"
/>

As you can see, during the winter months (and to a lesser extent in the summer),
much more of the generation's value is at the higher tier.
Note that for simplicity's sake, I used the net metering rates in effect for most of 2024 to calculate the above chart
($0.103 for the first block, $0.125 for the second).

In any case, my takeaway is that these numbers are not super impressive. But we're not done yet! There's two other aspects to this to explore: self consumption and the switch to time of use billing. We'll discuss these below.

<!--
TODO: Insert some kind of chart or graphic showing how this works
-->

### The value of self-consumption

Even under a net metering regime, there are some costs associated with the electricity consumed.
These are passed on to the consumer in the form of "distribution charges" which includes both a fixed portion and a variable one (currently about 2.5 cents per kWh where I live).
The fixed costs are impossible to avoid, but by self-consuming our solar output, we can avoid some of the variable costs.

```sql total_self_consumption
with utility_data as (
    select
        Month as month,
        "Electric kWh" as utility_measured_kwh,
        "Utility Electric kWhr" as utility_measured_kwhr
    from utility_measures.utility_measures
),
solar_data as (
    select
        date_trunc('month', cast(time as date)) as month,
        sum(kWh) as total_generated_kWh
    from utility_measures.solar_output
    group by month
),
all_months as (
    select distinct month from utility_data
    union
    select distinct month from solar_data
)
select
    sum(coalesce(sd.total_generated_kWh, 0)) - sum(ud.utility_measured_kwhr) as self_consumption,
    self_consumption * 0.025 as self_consumption_value
from all_months am
left join solar_data sd on am.month = sd.month
left join utility_data ud on am.month = ud.month
where am.month >= '2024-01-01' and am.month <= '2024-12-01'
```

In 2024, we self-consumed <Value 
    data={total_self_consumption}
    column=self_consumption 
    row=0
/> kWh worth of electricity from our solar system, which adds up to <Value 
    data={total_self_consumption}
    column=self_consumption_value
    row=0
    fmt=CAD
/>.

The nice thing about this is that it has a value that I expect to increase (slowly but steadily) year over year, irrespective of the whims of governments and utilities.

### Time of use billing: game changer?

In January 2024, it became possible for someone with a net metering contract (i.e. us) to switch from the tiered billing rate to time of use, both for _consumption_ and _production_.
The idea behind time-of-use is simple: charge people more during periods of peak demand (when more expensive dispatchable energy is likely to be in use) than non-peak.

Having the intuition that it would be better (since solar production corresponds to at least mid-peak), I asked my utility company to switch over.
It wasn't until I ran the numbers that I realized _how much better_ though.

Let's look at an arbitrary sunny day in September 2024:

```sql sunny_day_september_2024
select strftime(time, '%H:00') as hour, kWh, tou_rate, (kWh * tou_rate) as tou_value, tiered_rate, (kWh * tiered_rate) as tiered_value, (tou_value - tiered_value) / tiered_value as pct_improvement from
utility_measures.solar_output where time >= '2024-09-03 00:00:00' and time < '2024-09-04 00:00:00' and kWh > 0.1
```

<DataTable data={sunny_day_september_2024} totalRow=true rows=all>
    <Column id="hour" title="Hour" />
    <Column id="kWh" title="Solar Production (kWh)" />
    <Column id="tou_value" title="Time of Use Value" fmt=cad />
    <Column id="tiered_value" title="Tiered Value" fmt=cad />
    <Column id="pct_improvement" title="Percent Improvement" fmt=pct totalAgg="mean" />
</DataTable>

Huge difference! Those calculations are using the lower tier value, but still. Let's look at how that adds up over a year, taking our actual "tiered" consumption rates into account:

```sql monthly_tiered_vs_tou
with solar_monthly as (
    select
        date_trunc('month', cast(time as date)) as month,

        coalesce(sm.total_generated_kWh, 0) + coalesce(ud.utility_measured_kwh, 0) - coalesce(ud.utility_measured_kwhr, 0) as total_consumption
    from all_months am
    left join solar_monthly sm on am.month = sm.month

### Time to break-even

Details aside, the fundamental question I really wanted to answer was: does this investment make sense?
To try to answer it, I tried to project the numbers I got above for the net metering solution over the next 19 years:

The savings are broken into three categories:

- The value of the actual energy produced valued using Ontario's time of use rates
- The value of the distribution costs avoided due to self-consumption
- The value of harmonized sales tax (HST) avoided due to both of the above

You can adjust the slider above to see how the model performs under different scenarios.
I opted for a very conservative average 2% yearly increase over time (both for distribution costs and the value of energy).
If I had to guess, my suspicion is that it will be more than that, but I'm not entirely sure how much.
Energy prices in Ontario have historically been a hot potato and my guess is that political pressure will keep increases in check.

This model also assumes a slight (1%) degradation of system capability per year.

As usual, there are some caveats:

1. There's some amount of variation in solar insolation year over year (usually on the order of a few percentage points) whereas this model just asssumes we'll generate 2024 numbers indefinitely. A future of version of this dashboard will incorporate insolation predictions, but for now you can look at the [energy section](./energy).
1. [Consumer electricity prices actually _decreased_ slightly at the end of 2024](https://www.oeb.ca/consumer-information-and-protection/electricity-rates/historical-electricity-rates), so the estimates for the 2nd year might be high all other things being equal. I assumed that eventual rate increases would make this moot.

It also goes without saying there's a few assumptions going into this model:

1. The Ontario government continues to allow net metering under the current terms.
1. The system doesn't require repairs or maintenance outside of the warranty, which would also cost money.

Limitations aside, I think the overall picture holds: while not _absolutely_ horrible, a 15+ year payback period doesn't feel great and illustrates the challenges of residential solar in Ontario.
