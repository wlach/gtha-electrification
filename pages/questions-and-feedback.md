I'm happy to accept corrections, feedback, or even discussion on any of the content herein.
This site is an [evidence] dashboard hosted on GitHub.

- Factual corrections or suggested improvements to style and presentation can be filed as [issues] or [pull requests].
- General questions and/or discussion of the content _on this site_ can be posted to the [discussion forum]. Please avoid general posts or arguments about energy policy and other political matters. There's lots of other places to talk about those things.
