title: Some Notes on Electrification and Solar in Ontario, Canada
---

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm [Will Lachance](https://wrla.ch), a software developer living in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.
For those of you who don't know where Hamilton is, it's near Toronto.

In late 2023, my partner and I had a number of projects done on our house in, to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions while (we were hoping) save us some money. Specifically we:

- Replaced our end-of-life gas furnace with a cold-weather heat pump
- Added a small amount of insulation in strategic places based on our audit
- Got a 6kW solar system installed on our roof top
- Replaced our (rental) gas hot water heater with an electric model
- Replaced a gas stove with an induction range

Approximately a year after the work completed, I had enough data on the performance and financials to produce this site.
Putting this site together, I had a few goals:

1. To quantify the environmental impacts (if any) from adopting this type of technology.
1. To try to understand the prospects for this type of technology in the future. We benefited from various government programs in our case (Greener homes grants and loans) but it looks like those are on their way out. Would this have made sense without them?

In putting this together, I quickly realized there's just too many variables at play to really provide definitive answers on these questions.
Still, I felt by combining my own data with some credible figures (e.g. the CO2 emissions associated with natural gas and electrical generation in Ontario) I could at least provide some data which might be interesting to someone contemplating something similar.

This site is an interactive dashboard divided into a number of sections.
If you want a primer on what electrification looks like before getting into the numbers, start with [Electrification and Solar](./electrification-and-solar).
If heat pumps, solar panels, etc. are old hat to you and you want to dive straight into the numbers, you can skip straight to the [Energy](./energy), [Financials](./financials) and [Environmental Impact](./environmental-impact) sections.

(I have not done this yet, not sure if I will)

There's also a few appendices with various calculations and notes I made in developing this, which you can probably skip unless you're morbidly curious about the details of an Ontario electricity bill.

Finally, see [Questions and Feedback](./questions-and-feedback) if there are any lingering questions or comments you might have after reading the above.
